        <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="section-body"> Autism Spectrum Disorder is a mental developmental disorder that impairs the ability to communicate and
            interact. There is an increasing concern about this as we move towards urbanization. The main objective
            of this project is to develop a web application tool that makes people with Autism Spectrum Disorder
            (ASD) learn what behaviour is to be expected in various situations. In other words, it helps them to
            determine how they should respond to others by leveraging applications based on Natural language
            processing (NLP). This is achieved using various questions and answers in form of text or images.
            According to the answer input, feedback will be displayed through which the user can learn about that
            particular situation. </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Proposed Work</h2>
        <p class="section-body">Our web application consists of 100 questions on emotions and reactions. These questions deal
            with the feelings of people like how one should feel while he faces the given situation. The
            next 100 questions are the image recognition questions where the child is asked to tell what
            kind of emotion is depicted by the given image. Out of these hundred, some questions are the
            common situations one comes across daily. Some questions are multiple reaction questions
            where we need to find the correct emotion from the given picture which best suits the situation
            mentioned in the question. Then there are some questions where the image of the same person
            is given but the person suffers and shows different emotions and reactions, in different
            questions.</p>
            <p>The working of the proposed work is as follows:
                <ul>● In the developed web application, questions will be displayed one by one as the user
                    will be asked to tell the emotion or reaction depicted in the given image or in the given
                    situation.</ul>
                <ul>● The user then has to insert their answer upto best of their knowledge.</ul>
                <ul>● The answer given will be then processed and checked by the Natural Language
                    Processing (NLP) method. It strives to build machines that understands and responds
                    to text box voice data- and respond with text or speech of their own- in much the same
                    ways as humans do. </ul>
                <ul>● After the processing of the answer, feedback will be displayed on how the user has
                    performed in the given question.</ul>
                </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Methodologies Used</h2>
        <p class="section-body">The system was developed using Django for backend support and Python for scripting along with HTML, CSS to provide an interactive interface Machine Learning models were used to analyze facial expressions and respond appropriately.</p>
